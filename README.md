# spam-mail-detection
Developed a machine learning model to combat email overload by automatically classifying spam emails. The model leverages Logistic Regression with NLTK for classification. To analyze email text effectively, CountVectorizer transforms email content into numerical features based on word frequency. This allows the model to identify patterns in spam emails and filter them out.
